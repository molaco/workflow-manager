    This task establishes the foundational Rust project structure with iced GUI framework
    integration, including proper module organization, dependency configuration, and basic
    application scaffolding. The task creates the skeleton that all other components will
    build upon.
    
    A well-organized project structure is critical for maintainability and scalability.
    The modular architecture separates concerns (UI, state, models, persistence, scheduling)
    allowing parallel development of features. Proper iced integration from the start ensures
    the Elm architecture pattern is correctly implemented.
    
    The outcome is a compilable Rust application with iced GUI framework configured, module
    structure in place, and a basic "Hello World" window that demonstrates the application
    lifecycle. All dependencies are properly configured in Cargo.toml with appropriate
    feature flags.

  key_points:
    - "Use iced 0.13 with canvas, tokio, and advanced features enabled for cosmic-text integration"
    - "Follow standard Rust project conventions with cargo new, implementing minimal iced Application trait"
    - "Create 7 module directories (state, ui, models, persistence, scheduler, data) with mod.rs files"
    - "Set up proper Cargo.toml [profile.release] optimizations from the start"
    - "Include directories crate for cross-platform data path detection"
    - "Embed fonts using include_bytes!() for portability"
    - "Main.rs serves as application entry point, all modules export through mod.rs for clean API"

formal_verification:
  needed: false
  level: "None"
  explanation: |
    Formal verification is not needed for this foundational task because:
    
    1. No Complex Logic: The task involves primarily boilerplate code - project structure
       setup, module declarations, and basic iced Application trait implementation with 
       empty/minimal methods. There are no algorithms, state transitions, or complex 
       invariants to verify.
    
    2. Compiler Guarantees Sufficient: Rust's type system and compiler provide adequate
       safety guarantees for this structural code. The main risks (incorrect dependencies,
       missing modules) are caught at compile time.
    
    3. No Critical Properties: There are no safety-critical properties to verify at this
       stage. The task creates a "Hello World" application skeleton - failure modes are
       limited to compilation errors or the window not displaying, both immediately visible
       during development.
    
    4. Simple Acceptance Criteria: The acceptance criteria are straightforward and 
       verifiable through basic testing: successful compilation and window display. These
       don't require formal methods.
    
    5. Foundation Only: This task establishes structure for future functionality.
       Formal verification becomes relevant in later tasks that implement actual business
       logic (e.g., character state transitions, scheduling algorithms, data persistence
       guarantees).
    
    The appropriate verification approach for this task is standard Rust compilation checks
    and basic smoke tests to ensure the application launches correctly.

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "unit tests with integration smoke tests"
    rationale:
      - "Task focuses on project scaffolding with minimal logic, requiring compilation and structural verification"
      - "Unit tests verify module organization, visibility, and basic API contracts"
      - "Integration smoke tests ensure application lifecycle (init, update, view) functions correctly"
      - "No complex business logic to test - emphasis on structural integrity and iced framework integration"
      - "Tests validate that the foundation supports future parallel development of features"

task:

context:
  description: |
    This task establishes the foundational data layer for the Japanese kana learning application
    by defining core data structures for representing hiragana and katakana characters and
    implementing efficient lookup mechanisms. Each character is represented with complete metadata
    including Unicode values, romanization, stroke order information with SVG paths, median points
    for stroke direction visualization, and frequency rankings for ordered presentation.
    
    The character database serves as the single source of truth for all 92 kana characters
    (46 hiragana + 46 katakana) and powers multiple system components including flashcard generation,
    stroke animation, practice modes, and recognition systems. The implementation uses compile-time
    perfect hashing (phf::Map) for zero-cost O(1) lookups with data embedded directly in the binary
    from human-readable RON (Rusty Object Notation) files.
    
    This architectural choice trades binary size for runtime performance while maintaining
    developer-friendly data files that can be easily validated, edited, and version controlled.
    The stroke path data extracted from external sources (kana-svg-data repository) enables
    accurate stroke-by-stroke animation and visualization critical for teaching proper writing
    technique.

  key_points:
    - "CharData struct serves as the canonical representation of a kana character with all necessary metadata"
    - "Compile-time phf::Map provides zero-cost O(1) character lookups with no runtime initialization overhead"
    - "RON format data files enable human-readable, version-controllable character data with serde deserialization"
    - "SVG path strings stored directly allow lazy parsing only when animation is needed"
    - "Median points enable stroke direction arrows without real-time path analysis"
    - "Frequency rankings support pedagogically-ordered presentation (common characters first)"
    - "Separation of hiragana.ron and katakana.ron mirrors natural script categorization"
    - "Data integrity enforced through comprehensive unit and property-based tests"

formal_verification:
  needed: false
  level: "None"
  explanation: |
    Formal verification is not needed for this task because:
    
    1. The character data is static, deterministic, and observable. All properties
       can be verified through conventional unit testing and property-based testing
       without requiring formal methods.
    
    2. The core operations are simple lookups and data structure definitions with
       no complex algorithmic logic, state transitions, or concurrent access patterns
       that would benefit from formal verification.
    
    3. The risk profile is low - incorrect character data would be immediately visible
       in testing and usage, and failures are not safety-critical. The worst-case
       scenario is incorrect character metadata, which is easily detectable and fixable.
    
    4. The acceptance criteria explicitly lists property-based testing as the verification
       strategy, which is appropriate for verifying data integrity properties like:
       - Completeness (all 92 characters present)
       - Unicode validity (all code points are valid)
       - Stroke count correctness (matches expected values)
       - SVG path parseability (no panics)
    
    5. The data source (kana-svg-data repository) is well-established and can be
       validated through comparison testing rather than formal proofs.
    
    Property-based testing with proptest provides sufficient confidence for this
    data-loading task without the overhead of formal verification tooling.

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "mixed (unit tests + property-based)"
    rationale:
      - "Character data is static and deterministic, making it ideal for unit tests to verify data integrity"
      - "Property-based testing ensures all characters satisfy structural invariants across the entire dataset"
      - "Lookup operations are pure functions with predictable behavior, testable in isolation"
      - "SVG path parsing needs edge case coverage for malformed data"
      - "Compile-time data embedding requires verification that all 92 characters are present and valid"
      - "Zero-cost abstractions (phf maps) need performance characteristics verified"

  name: "Japanese Font Integration and Text Rendering"

context:
  description: |
    This task establishes the foundation for Japanese text rendering in the kana learning
    application by integrating Noto Sans JP font and creating a custom CharacterCard widget
    for flashcard-style character display. Proper Unicode rendering is critical for a Japanese
    learning application, as hiragana and katakana characters require proper glyph shaping
    that goes beyond basic ASCII rendering.
    
    The implementation uses iced's cosmic-text backend with Advanced shaping mode to ensure
    correct rendering of all Japanese characters. The Noto Sans JP font is embedded directly
    into the binary using include_bytes!() for cross-platform portability, eliminating
    runtime font loading issues.
    
    The CharacterCard widget abstracts the complexity of Japanese text rendering behind a
    simple, reusable interface. It provides consistent character presentation across the
    application with configurable sizing, styling, and optional stroke order overlay support.
    This widget will be the primary display component for flashcards, practice exercises,
    and character review screens.

  key_points:
    - "Noto Sans JP font (~900KB) is embedded at compile-time for guaranteed availability"
    - "cosmic-text requires Shaping::Advanced mode for proper Japanese glyph rendering"
    - "CharacterCard implements iced::Widget trait for seamless framework integration"
    - "Font loading happens at application startup to fail fast if font data is corrupted"
    - "Widget supports both hiragana (U+3041-U+3096) and katakana (U+30A1-U+30FA) ranges"
    - "Character centering uses coordinate calculations for both horizontal and vertical alignment"
    - "Optional stroke order overlay architecture allows future Canvas integration"

formal_verification:
  needed: false
  level: "None"
  explanation: |
    Font loading and text rendering are primarily concerned with integration
    with the iced framework and cosmic-text library, not with algorithmic
    correctness or safety-critical properties that would benefit from formal
    verification.
    
    The key concerns are:
    1. Font data is loaded from a static embedded resource (include_bytes!)
    2. Font loading either succeeds or fails - binary outcome, no complex state
    3. Text rendering is delegated to cosmic-text library (already tested)
    4. CharacterCard widget implements iced::Widget trait following framework contracts
    
    Potential failure modes (missing glyphs, incorrect centering, font load errors)
    are best caught through integration testing and visual inspection rather than
    formal methods. The widget's draw() method performs coordinate calculations
    for centering, but these are straightforward geometric operations not requiring
    formal proof.
    
    Runtime behavior is deterministic and observable - if Japanese text doesn't
    render correctly, it will be immediately apparent during testing. There are
    no subtle race conditions, memory safety issues (Rust's type system handles this),
    or complex invariants that formal verification would help establish.
    
    Integration testing with actual font files and visual regression checks provide
    more practical assurance for this graphics-oriented task.

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "mixed (unit + integration)"
    rationale:
      - "Font loading is a system integration point requiring integration tests to verify actual file I/O and font system interaction"
      - "CharacterCard widget behavior (layout, sizing) can be unit tested in isolation"
      - "Glyph rendering validation requires integration tests with actual cosmic-text backend"
      - "Font embedding verification must run at compile-time (via include_bytes!) and runtime"
      - "Visual rendering is difficult to assert programmatically; focus on no-panic guarantees and basic measurements"

task:
  id: 4
  name: "Stroke Order Animation System"

context:
  description: |
    This task implements a GPU-accelerated stroke-by-stroke animation system for displaying
    Chinese character stroke order using iced's Canvas widget and Animation API. The system
    is the primary visual teaching tool in the application, rendering character strokes
    sequentially with smooth partial path drawing, configurable timing, and natural easing
    curves that mimic human handwriting motion.
    
    The implementation uses lyon tessellation for GPU-accelerated rendering to ensure 60fps
    animation even on lower-end hardware. Sequential stroke rendering with proper timing
    helps learners internalize correct writing patterns, which is pedagogically essential
    for Chinese character acquisition.
    
    The system parses SVG path data into structured PathSegment enums, precomputes stroke
    lengths for accurate partial rendering, and uses iced's Animation API to interpolate
    progress values. Each stroke draws progressively over 500-800ms with 200-300ms pauses
    between strokes. Completed strokes render in black while the current animating stroke
    appears in blue for clear visual differentiation.

  key_points:
    - "GPU acceleration via lyon tessellation ensures consistent 60fps performance"
    - "Partial path rendering requires accurate length calculation including bezier curve approximation"
    - "Animation timing uses natural easing curves (EaseOutCubic) to mimic human handwriting motion"
    - "SVG path parsing must handle all standard commands: M, L, C, S, Q for compatibility"
    - "State management tracks current stroke index, progress, and animation lifecycle"
    - "Visual feedback uses color coding: black (completed), blue (animating), gray (pending)"
    - "Reusable component architecture allows integration across practice and review modes"
    - "Floating-point precision in bezier calculations requires numerical approximation methods"

formal_verification:
  needed: false
  level: "None"
  explanation: |
    Formal verification is not required for the stroke order animation system for the following reasons:

    1. **Nature of the Problem Domain**: This is a graphical animation and rendering task focused on
       visual presentation and user experience. The correctness criteria are primarily perceptual
       (smoothness, timing, visual appearance) rather than logical or mathematical invariants that
       would benefit from formal proof.

    2. **Testing Coverage Suffices**: The critical properties of this system—animation timing,
       path rendering continuity, frame rate performance, and state transitions—can be effectively
       verified through property-based testing and integration tests. The task overview already
       identifies 8 tests with property testing enabled, which adequately covers the deterministic
       aspects of animation logic.

    3. **Low Safety Criticality**: Failures in this component result in poor user experience
       (visual glitches, incorrect timing) but pose no safety, security, or data integrity risks.
       Unlike concurrent systems, financial calculations, or security-critical code, animation
       rendering errors are immediately visible and non-catastrophic.

    4. **Non-Deterministic Human Judgment**: Key quality criteria like "natural handwriting feel"
       and appropriate easing curves require human evaluation and iterative tuning rather than
       formal proof. The notes acknowledge this: "Animation timing may need tuning based on user
       feedback."

    5. **Complexity vs. Benefit Trade-off**: While the task has high complexity risk (SVG parsing,
       floating-point calculations for Bezier curves), formal verification would be
       disproportionately expensive. The identified risks (edge cases, precision issues) are better
       addressed through comprehensive unit tests, property-based testing for path calculations,
       and integration testing for animation sequences.

    6. **Testable Deterministic Core**: The deterministic portions (path segment parsing, length
       calculation, progress interpolation) are well-suited to property-based testing with proptest,
       which provides strong correctness guarantees without the overhead of formal verification.

    Recommendation: Focus testing effort on property-based tests for path mathematics (length
    calculations, partial path continuity) and integration tests for animation state machines,
    supplemented by manual visual inspection for perceptual quality.

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "mixed"
    rationale:
      - "Unit tests verify path parsing logic, segment length calculations, and state transitions independently"
      - "Property-based tests ensure mathematical correctness of partial path calculations across edge cases"
      - "Integration tests validate animation timing, sequencing, and rendering coordination"
      - "Visual properties (smoothness, timing feel) require manual inspection but core logic is deterministically testable"
      - "Performance benchmarks verify 60fps requirement under various stroke complexities"

task:
  id: 5
  name: "Handwriting Canvas and Input System"

context:
  description: |
    This task implements an interactive drawing canvas that captures user handwriting
    input through mouse or touch interactions. The canvas records stroke sequences with
    timestamps, provides real-time visual feedback during drawing, and outputs normalized
    stroke data suitable for character recognition systems.
    
    The HandwritingCanvas widget serves as the primary interface for handwriting practice
    exercises, enabling users to draw characters either freehand or following guide overlays.
    The system must feel responsive and natural, with smooth stroke rendering achieved through
    anti-aliased paths with round caps and joins. Proper point sampling with distance
    thresholding prevents noise accumulation while maintaining stroke fidelity.
    
    The canvas implements the iced canvas::Program trait, handling a state machine that
    transitions between idle, drawing, and completed states. Stroke data is captured as
    sequences of timestamped points, normalized to a 0-1 coordinate range for recognition
    system compatibility. The implementation supports clear and undo operations, maintains
    stroke history in chronological order, and provides visual differentiation between
    in-progress and completed strokes.
    
    This component is foundational to the practice mode (Task 8) and provides the stroke
    data format consumed by the recognition system (Task 9). It must work reliably across
    both desktop (mouse) and touch-enabled devices, with consistent point sampling rates
    and continuous stroke capture without gaps from missed events.

formal_verification:
  needed: false
  level: "None"
  explanation: |
    Formal verification is not needed for the Handwriting Canvas and Input System
    for the following reasons:

    1. UI Interaction Logic: The core functionality involves GUI event handling
       (mouse/touch input) and rendering, which are inherently difficult to
       formally verify and typically don't require it. The correctness can be
       adequately validated through integration and manual testing.

    2. No Safety-Critical Properties: The canvas system doesn't involve
       safety-critical operations, security boundaries, or data integrity
       guarantees that would warrant formal verification. Incorrect behavior
       results in poor user experience (e.g., choppy strokes, missed points)
       rather than system failures or data corruption.

    3. Deterministic but Not Complex: While the stroke capture logic is
       deterministic (event → point → stroke), the state machine is simple
       enough that traditional testing approaches (unit and integration tests)
       provide sufficient confidence. The distance threshold and point sampling
       are heuristic optimizations rather than correctness-critical algorithms.

    4. Visual Output Validation: The primary correctness criteria (smooth
       rendering, responsive feedback) are inherently visual and subjective,
       making them unsuitable for formal verification. These are best validated
       through integration tests with simulated input and visual regression
       testing.

    5. Testing Strategy Sufficient: The planned integration testing with
       simulated mouse events, combined with property-based testing for stroke
       data normalization, provides adequate coverage for the critical
       properties (stroke continuity, point sampling consistency, sequence
       ordering) without formal methods.

    The acceptance criteria can be fully validated through conventional testing:
    stroke continuity through event simulation, anti-aliasing through visual
    inspection, distance thresholds through unit tests, and data export through
    serialization tests.

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "mixed (unit + integration)"
    rationale:
      - "Unit tests verify stroke data structures, normalization, and distance threshold logic in isolation"
      - "Integration tests simulate mouse/touch event sequences to validate state machine transitions and rendering pipeline"
      - "Canvas interaction requires event simulation to ensure proper stroke capture, completion, and clear/undo operations"
      - "Property-based testing ensures normalization correctness across arbitrary coordinate ranges"
      - "Integration approach validates the complete drawing workflow from input to stroke data export"

task:
  id: 6
  name: "Application State Management and Navigation"

context:
  description: |
    This task implements the core Elm architecture state management system for the application,
    establishing the foundation for all user interactions and application behavior. The Elm
    architecture provides a predictable, unidirectional data flow pattern where all state changes
    occur through pure functions, making the application highly testable and maintainable.
    
    The state management system centers around three key concepts:
    1. AppState - The single source of truth for all application data
    2. Message - Enumeration of all possible events and user interactions
    3. update() - Pure function that transitions from one state to another based on messages
    
    This architecture ensures that application behavior is deterministic, side effects are
    isolated to command execution, and the application remains in a valid state at all times.
    The Screen enum enables navigation between different application modes (menu, learning,
    practice, statistics) while maintaining session state and user progress.
    
    State management is the control flow backbone of the application - all other systems
    (UI rendering, database persistence, recognition) coordinate through this central state.
    Proper implementation prevents entire classes of bugs related to invalid state transitions,
    race conditions, and inconsistent UI updates.

  key_points:
    - "Elm architecture provides unidirectional data flow: View → Message → Update → State → View"
    - "All state transitions are pure functions with no side effects (except Task creation)"
    - "Screen enum encapsulates screen-specific state to prevent invalid state combinations"
    - "Shared state (progress, settings) uses Arc<RwLock> for thread-safe concurrent access"
    - "Async operations (database, recognition) return Messages via Task/Command pattern"
    - "Navigation maintains clear parent-child relationships allowing proper back navigation"
    - "Session state (learning/practice) is owned by Screen variants and cleaned up on exit"
    - "Message routing ensures exhaustive handling of all interaction types"

formal_verification:
  needed: true
  level: "Basic"
  explanation: |
    State management is the critical foundation of the Elm architecture and requires
    formal verification to ensure correctness. The update() function and state 
    transitions form the control flow backbone - bugs here cascade throughout the
    entire application. While full critical-level verification isn't necessary, basic
    formal verification is warranted because:

    1. State transitions must maintain invariants (no unreachable/invalid states)
    2. The update function must be a total function (handle all Message variants)
    3. Navigation state must form a valid state machine with no deadlocks
    4. Session state ownership transfers during screen transitions must be sound
    5. Shared state access patterns (Arc<RwLock>) must be deadlock-free

    The complexity risk is high and this is a central integration point, making
    verification valuable. However, the domain logic itself isn't safety-critical
    (not medical/financial), so Basic level suffices. Property-based testing can
    supplement formal verification for state transition coverage.

  properties:
    - name: "State Transition Totality"
      formal_statement: "∀s:AppState, ∀m:Message, ∃s':AppState such that update(s,m) = (s', Task)"
      
    - name: "Screen Variant Exhaustiveness"
      formal_statement: "∀screen:Screen, screen ∈ {MainMenu, Learning, Practice, Statistics, Settings, ...} and pattern match on Screen is exhaustive"
      
    - name: "Message Handling Completeness"
      formal_statement: "∀msg:Message, ∃branch in update(state, msg) that handles msg (no unreachable messages)"
      
    - name: "Navigation Invariant"
      formal_statement: "If transition(s, Navigate(screen)) = s', then s'.current_screen = screen ∧ screen state is properly initialized"
      
    - name: "Session State Ownership"
      formal_statement: "When transitioning from Learning(session) to another screen, session data is either persisted or explicitly dropped (no orphaned state)"
      
    - name: "Shared State Safety"
      formal_statement: "All Arc<RwLock<T>> accesses follow acquire-release order: read_lock() or write_lock() always acquired before access, released before await points"
      
    - name: "Update Purity"
      formal_statement: "update(s, m) = (s', task) is pure: same inputs always produce same outputs, no side effects except Task creation"
      
    - name: "State Machine Validity"
      formal_statement: "The screen transition graph is a valid DAG or contains only intentional cycles (e.g., MainMenu ↔ Learning), with no deadlock states"

  strategy:
    - "Use Rust's type system for exhaustiveness checking - ensure all enum variants are handled"
    - "Employ proptest for property-based testing of state transitions (generate random Message sequences, verify invariants hold)"
    - "Implement compile-time checks via type states where possible (e.g., session must exist to enter Learning screen)"
    - "Use static analysis tools (clippy, miri) to detect Arc<RwLock> deadlock patterns"
    - "Create state transition table and verify coverage with test matrix (all Screen × Message combinations)"
    - "Use debug assertions in update() to validate preconditions/postconditions during development"
    - "Model state machine formally using TLA+ or similar for navigation flow verification (optional but recommended)"

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "unit tests with property-based testing"
    rationale:
      - "State transitions are pure functions making them ideal for unit testing"
      - "Property-based testing ensures state consistency invariants hold across all possible transitions"
      - "No external dependencies (UI, database) needed for core update logic testing"
      - "High criticality warrants comprehensive coverage of all message handlers and screen transitions"
      - "Testing invalid state transitions ensures robustness and prevents runtime panics"

task:
  id: 7
  name: "SM-2 Spaced Repetition Algorithm and Review Queue"

context:
  description: |
    This task implements the SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm, the core pedagogical engine
    that drives effective long-term vocabulary retention in the learning system. SM-2 is a
    battle-tested algorithm from SuperMemo that calculates optimal review intervals based on
    user performance, adjusting difficulty through an ease factor mechanism.
    
    The implementation provides two primary components: SM2Card, which represents individual
    flashcards with scheduling metadata (ease factor, interval, repetitions, next review date),
    and ReviewQueue, which manages card prioritization across three queues (learning, review, new)
    according to SRS best practices.
    
    This system ensures learners encounter cards at scientifically-optimized intervals that
    maximize retention while minimizing study time. Failed cards automatically return to the
    learning pool, while successfully reviewed cards have progressively longer intervals calculated
    through the SM-2 formula. Daily limits prevent cognitive overload while maintaining consistent
    study habits.

  key_points:
    - "SM-2 algorithm maintains per-card ease factor (default 2.5, floor 1.3) that adjusts based on review quality"
    - "First two intervals are fixed (1 day, 6 days), subsequent intervals multiply by ease factor"
    - "Quality ratings 0-2 reset cards to learning state; ratings 3-5 advance to next interval"
    - "ReviewQueue prioritizes learning cards over due reviews over new cards for optimal pedagogy"
    - "Daily limits (configurable new cards and review caps) prevent user overwhelm"
    - "Floating-point arithmetic in ease factor calculations requires careful handling"
    - "State machine transitions (New -> Learning -> Review -> Relearning) must be deterministic"
    - "Review history tracking enables future algorithm improvements and analytics"

formal_verification:
  needed: true
  level: "Basic"
  explanation: |
    The SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm involves mathematical calculations with specific
    constraints and invariants that are critical to the learning system's effectiveness.
    While full formal verification is not necessary, property-based testing with formally
    stated properties is essential because:
    
    1. The algorithm has well-defined mathematical properties (ease factor bounds,
       interval monotonicity) that must hold for all inputs
    2. Incorrect scheduling directly impacts learning outcomes - cards shown too early
       waste time, cards shown too late lead to forgetting
    3. Floating-point arithmetic in ease factor calculations can introduce subtle bugs
       that only manifest with certain input sequences
    4. The state machine transitions (new -> learning -> review) must be deterministic
       and reversible for failed cards
    5. Queue prioritization logic has ordering invariants that affect user experience
    
    Basic-level verification through property-based testing provides high confidence
    without the overhead of theorem proving, which is appropriate for this domain where
    the algorithm is well-established and the risk is moderate rather than critical.

  strategy:
    approach: "unit tests with property-based testing"
    rationale:
      - "SM-2 algorithm is deterministic and mathematical, making it ideal for unit testing"
      - "Property-based testing verifies critical invariants like ease factor bounds and interval monotonicity"
      - "State transitions can be exhaustively tested with all quality ratings (0-5)"
      - "Queue prioritization logic requires systematic testing of all scenarios"
      - "No external dependencies or I/O operations simplify testing"
      - "Floating-point calculations need precision verification"

task:
  id: 9
  name: "Character Recognition Integration"

context:
  description: |
    This task implements the character recognition engine that validates user-drawn
    strokes and returns candidate matches with confidence scores. The system accepts
    raw stroke data from the drawing canvas, normalizes coordinates to be resolution-
    independent, preprocesses the data (resampling, smoothing), and interfaces with
    a recognition library (hanzi_lookup or similar) to identify potential character
    matches.
    
    Recognition is critical for providing objective assessment in practice mode,
    allowing the system to validate that users can accurately reproduce kana
    characters from memory. The implementation must balance accuracy with user
    experience - thresholds that are too strict will frustrate learners, while
    overly permissive validation allows incorrect forms to pass.
    
    The recognition pipeline consists of three main stages:
    1. Normalization: Scaling coordinates to unit square (0-1 range), resampling
       to consistent point counts, and smoothing noise
    2. Recognition: Converting to engine format and calling recognition backend
       via FFI or WASM bridge
    3. Validation: Checking if expected character appears in top-N results with
       sufficient confidence, generating helpful feedback for failures
    
    Key challenges include handling the variability of human handwriting, tuning
    confidence thresholds and top-N parameters, ensuring sub-200ms response times,
    and providing actionable feedback when recognition fails. The system must also
    handle edge cases like incorrect stroke counts, which are common learner errors.

  key_points:
    - "Normalization must preserve stroke order and direction while making input resolution-independent"
    - "Recognition library integration may require FFI bindings or WASM bridge depending on implementation language"
    - "Threshold tuning affects user experience critically - requires empirical testing with real handwriting data"
    - "Performance requirement of <200ms constrains preprocessing and recognition complexity"
    - "False positive rate <5% prevents accepting incorrect character forms"
    - "Stroke count validation provides fast pre-check before expensive recognition"
    - "Most recognition libraries focus on kanji; kana support may be limited or require custom model training"
    - "Feedback generation should identify common errors (stroke count, order, shape) to guide learners"

formal_verification:
  needed: false
  level: "None"
  explanation: |
    Formal verification is not needed for the character recognition integration task
    for several reasons:
    
    1. **Heuristic Nature**: Character recognition is fundamentally heuristic and 
       probabilistic. The system deals with confidence scores, thresholds, and 
       statistical matching rather than deterministic logical properties that can 
       be formally verified.
    
    2. **External Dependencies**: The core recognition logic resides in external 
       libraries (hanzi_lookup or similar). We cannot formally verify third-party 
       recognition engines, only test their integration.
    
    3. **Empirical Validation Required**: Recognition accuracy, false positive rates,
       and threshold effectiveness can only be validated empirically with real 
       handwriting data, not through formal proofs. The 5% false positive rate and
       <200ms performance requirements are statistical properties measured through
       testing.
    
    4. **Preprocessing is Simple**: Stroke normalization (coordinate scaling to 0-1,
       resampling) involves straightforward mathematical transformations that are
       easily validated through unit and property-based testing rather than formal
       verification.
    
    5. **UX-Focused Outcomes**: The task's critical properties (helpful feedback,
       appropriate threshold strictness, user experience) are qualitative and 
       cannot be formally verified.
    
    6. **Cost-Benefit**: The high complexity and integration risks stem from library
       compatibility and tuning challenges, not from logical correctness issues that
       formal verification would address. Comprehensive integration testing with
       real stroke data provides better validation than formal methods for this
       domain.
    
    The testing strategy (integration tests with sample stroke data, property-based
    tests for normalization invariants, performance benchmarks) is more appropriate
    and cost-effective for validating this component.

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "mixed (unit + integration + property-based)"
    rationale:
      - "Unit tests verify stroke normalization, resampling, and preprocessing in isolation"
      - "Integration tests validate end-to-end recognition pipeline with real stroke data"
      - "Property-based tests ensure normalization preserves critical invariants across input variations"
      - "Performance tests verify <200ms response time requirement"
      - "False positive rate validation requires statistical testing over sample dataset"

  name: "Statistics and Progress Visualization"

context:
  description: |
    This task implements comprehensive statistics tracking and visualization for user
    progress in the flashcard application. It creates a Statistics struct that aggregates
    review data into meaningful metrics including accuracy rates, study streaks, cards
    mastered, and time-series data for daily/weekly progress tracking.
    
    Progress visualization is a critical motivational component in spaced repetition
    systems. By providing learners with clear visibility into their accuracy trends,
    study consistency (streaks), and mastery progress, the system encourages regular
    practice and provides positive reinforcement. The gamification elements (achievements,
    streak tracking) leverage psychological principles to build habit formation.
    
    The implementation uses efficient data structures (BTreeMap for time-series data,
    HashSet for study days tracking) to enable fast queries and aggregations. Statistics
    are updated incrementally during learning sessions and persisted by the database
    layer. A dedicated statistics screen renders all metrics with visual components
    including progress bars, streak indicators, and achievement badges.
    
    The system tracks both granular (per-review) and aggregated (daily, weekly) metrics,
    enabling future analytics capabilities and personalized learning recommendations
    based on historical patterns.

  key_points:
    - "Statistics are updated incrementally during sessions, batch-saved at session end to minimize I/O"
    - "BTreeMap keyed by date enables efficient time-range queries for historical data"
    - "Streak calculation uses consecutive days algorithm on study_days HashSet"
    - "Card maturity stages: new (interval=0), learning (interval<21 days), mature (interval>=21 days)"
    - "Timezone handling critical for correct day boundary detection near midnight"
    - "Achievement system provides gamification and milestone celebration"
    - "All calculations are deterministic and suitable for unit/property-based testing"

formal_verification:
  needed: false
  level: "None"
  explanation: |
    Formal verification is not necessary for this task because:
    
    1. **Deterministic Mathematical Operations**: The statistics calculations (accuracy 
       rates, streak counting, aggregations) are straightforward arithmetic operations 
       with well-understood properties. These can be thoroughly validated through 
       comprehensive unit tests and property-based testing.
    
    2. **No Critical Safety Requirements**: This is a visualization and metrics tracking 
       feature. Incorrect statistics do not pose safety risks, data corruption risks, 
       or financial risks. An error in accuracy calculation or streak counting would 
       be a user experience issue, not a critical failure.
    
    3. **No Complex Concurrency**: The statistics are updated incrementally during a 
       learning session and persisted at the end. There are no complex concurrent 
       access patterns or race conditions that would benefit from formal verification.
    
    4. **No Invariant Complexity**: The invariants (e.g., accuracy is always between 
       0-100%, streak is non-negative, total reviews equals sum of correct + incorrect) 
       are simple and can be validated with assertions and property tests.
    
    5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: The development effort required for formal verification 
       would significantly outweigh the benefits for a non-critical feature. Property-based 
       testing with tools like proptest provides sufficient confidence for statistical 
       calculations.
    
    The testing strategy (property-based testing recommended) will adequately verify:
    - Accuracy calculation bounds and correctness
    - Streak calculation logic for consecutive/non-consecutive days
    - Monotonicity properties (total reviews only increases, never decreases)
    - Aggregation consistency (daily stats sum to totals)
    - Achievement unlock trigger conditions
    
    These properties are best verified through extensive property-based tests that 
    generate random sequences of reviews and verify the mathematical relationships hold.

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "mixed (unit tests + property-based testing)"
    rationale:
      - "Statistics calculations are pure mathematical functions best verified with unit tests"
      - "Property-based testing ensures streak calculations and aggregations hold for arbitrary date sequences"
      - "Achievement unlock logic requires deterministic unit tests for milestone boundaries"
      - "Time-series aggregations benefit from property testing to verify invariants across date ranges"
      - "Timezone handling for day boundaries requires specific edge case unit tests"
      - "No integration testing needed - statistics are derived purely from data transformations"

task:
  id: 11
  name: "Local Persistence and Database Layer"

context:
  description: |
    This task implements the foundational persistence layer for the flashcard application using
    the redb embedded database. Persistence is the backbone of user trust - without reliable
    data storage, users lose progress, confidence, and motivation to continue learning.
    
    The persistence layer wraps redb to provide type-safe, transactional operations for all
    application data: flashcards, spaced repetition state (SM2 parameters), review history,
    user settings, and learning statistics. The implementation prioritizes data integrity through
    ACID transactions, crash recovery, and atomic batch operations.
    
    Key architectural decisions include using bincode for fast serialization (internal operations)
    and JSON for backups (human-readable, portable), leveraging the directories crate for
    platform-appropriate file paths, and designing batch operations to minimize write overhead
    during learning sessions. The backup/restore functionality enables data portability and
    disaster recovery.
    
    This layer serves as the integration point for all stateful components - the learning session
    saves progress here, statistics accumulate here, and user preferences persist here. The design
    ensures that even in the event of application crashes or system failures, user data remains
    consistent and recoverable.

  key_points:
    - "redb provides ACID guarantees without external database dependencies (embedded, zero-config)"
    - "Batch write operations critical for performance - save entire session state in single transaction"
    - "Platform-independent data directory using directories crate (XDG on Linux, AppData on Windows, Application Support on macOS)"
    - "Dual serialization strategy: bincode for speed, JSON for portability and debugging"
    - "Read transactions are cheap and don't block - can query liberally without performance penalty"
    - "Write transactions block other writes - must minimize frequency through batching"
    - "Backup/restore enables data portability and recovery from corruption"
    - "Thread-safe concurrent access required for future multi-threaded operations"

formal_verification:
  needed: true
  level: "Basic"
  explanation: |
    The database layer requires basic formal verification due to its critical role in
    data integrity and the severe consequences of failures (data loss, corruption).
    While full formal verification is not necessary, key properties around ACID
    guarantees, serialization correctness, and crash recovery must be verified.
    
    The primary concerns are:
    1. Transaction atomicity - partial writes must never occur
    2. Data integrity - serialization/deserialization must be bijective
    3. Concurrent access safety - read/write conflicts must not cause corruption
    4. Crash recovery - database must remain consistent after abnormal termination
    
    Since redb itself provides ACID guarantees, we focus on verifying that our
    wrapper layer correctly uses redb's API and doesn't introduce bugs in
    serialization, batch operations, or backup/restore logic. Property-based
    testing can verify serialization round-trips and transaction isolation.

  properties:
    - name: "Serialization Bijectivity"
      formal_statement: "∀ data: T, deserialize(serialize(data)) = Ok(data)"
    
    - name: "Transaction Atomicity"
      formal_statement: "∀ batch_operation: if any item fails, no items are persisted"
    
    - name: "Backup Restore Equivalence"
      formal_statement: "∀ db_state: restore(export(db_state)) ≡ db_state"
    
    - name: "Concurrent Read Consistency"
      formal_statement: "∀ concurrent reads R1, R2 on same key: R1 = R2 if no writes occur between them"
    
    - name: "Write Visibility"
      formal_statement: "∀ write W followed by read R on same key: R observes W or a later write, never stale data"

  strategy:
    - "Use property-based testing (proptest) to verify serialization bijectivity for all data types"
    - "Integration tests that simulate crashes (drop write transaction mid-operation) to verify atomicity"
    - "Concurrent test scenarios using multiple threads performing reads/writes to verify isolation"
    - "Round-trip tests for backup/restore with random data sets to ensure equivalence"
    - "Stress tests with large batch operations to verify performance guarantees and transaction integrity"

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "mixed (unit + integration + concurrency)"
    rationale:
      - "Database operations require real redb instance for integration testing to verify ACID properties"
      - "Unit tests validate serialization/deserialization independently without database overhead"
      - "Concurrency tests ensure thread-safety of read/write operations"
      - "Integration tests verify data persistence across database open/close cycles"
      - "Property-based tests validate backup/restore invariants and data integrity"
      - "Critical path testing for batch operations performance requirements (<100ms for 50 cards)"

  id: 8
  name: "Learning Session and Practice Modes"

context:
  description: |
    This task implements the core learning workflow systems that bring together all
    previous components into cohesive, polished learning experiences. The learning
    session system manages the review queue progression, presenting flashcards to
    users, collecting quality ratings, and updating SM-2 scheduling state. The
    practice mode system provides a four-stage progressive difficulty framework:
    passive observation of stroke animations, guided tracing with visual overlays,
    unguided tracing, and free drawing from memory.

    These systems represent the convergence point where character data, spaced
    repetition algorithms, stroke animations, handwriting recognition, and UI
    components integrate into complete user-facing features. The quality of
    implementation directly impacts learning effectiveness and user satisfaction.

    The learning session acts as a state machine coordinating ReviewQueue, SM2Card
    updates, user input handling, and progress persistence. It must handle
    interruption/resumption gracefully, batch database operations for performance,
    and provide rich feedback and statistics. The practice session similarly
    orchestrates stroke animations, drawing canvas interactions, handwriting
    validation, and progressive difficulty transitions.

    Both systems emphasize immediate visual feedback, keyboard shortcuts for
    efficiency, comprehensive statistics tracking, and robust state management to
    ensure reliable learning experiences across session boundaries.

  key_points:
    - "Session workflows are complex state machines requiring careful transition management"
    - "Database batching (every 5-10 cards) critical for performance without data loss risk"
    - "Practice mode progression gates on successful recognition validation"
    - "Keyboard shortcuts significantly improve review flow efficiency"
    - "Session interruption/resumption requires persistent state management"
    - "Integration points span character data, SM-2, animations, canvas, and persistence"
    - "Visual feedback must be immediate and unambiguous (green check, red X)"
    - "Statistics tracking enables user progress awareness and system analytics"

formal_verification:
  needed: false
  level: "None"
  explanation: |
    Formal verification is not needed for the learning session and practice modes
    because:

    1. UI-Heavy Component: This task primarily implements user interface state
       machines and interaction flows. The correctness of UI behavior is better
       validated through integration testing and user testing rather than formal
       verification.

    2. Non-Critical Correctness: While the session logic must work correctly,
       errors in session state (e.g., incorrect card ordering, UI glitches) do not
       have safety-critical consequences. They affect user experience but don't
       compromise data integrity or system security. The underlying SM-2 algorithm
       (Task 7) handles the critical scheduling logic.

    3. Complex State Machines with External Input: Both LearningSession and
       PracticeSession are state machines driven by asynchronous user input (button
       clicks, drawing, quality ratings). Formal verification of interactive systems
       with human-in-the-loop is significantly more complex than algorithmic
       verification and provides limited practical benefit.

    4. Integration-Heavy: The session workflows integrate multiple components
       (ReviewQueue, StrokeOrderAnimation, HandwritingCanvas, CharacterCard). The
       correctness depends on proper integration rather than algorithmic properties.
       Integration tests are more appropriate for verifying end-to-end behavior.

    5. Statistical Tracking: Session statistics (accuracy, time tracking) are
       primarily for user feedback. Small inaccuracies don't compromise system
       function, and the implementation is straightforward counting/timing logic.

    6. Database Batching: While batching saves (every 5-10 cards) requires
       careful implementation to avoid data loss, this is better addressed through
       thorough integration testing with simulated failures rather than formal
       verification. The persistence layer (Task 11) handles the underlying
       transaction guarantees.

    The acceptance criteria focus on behavioral correctness (cards present in order,
    ratings update correctly, practice progression works) which are effectively
    validated through integration tests that exercise the full session workflows.

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "mixed (unit + integration + property-based)"
    rationale:
      - "Session state machines require integration tests to verify end-to-end workflows across multiple components"
      - "Unit tests isolate session logic from UI and verify state transitions independently"
      - "Integration tests ensure correct coordination between ReviewQueue, SM2Algorithm, StrokeAnimation, and Canvas"
      - "Mock-based tests avoid database dependencies while verifying save behavior"
      - "Property-based tests verify session invariants hold across arbitrary input sequences"

task:
  id: 12
  name: "Visual Feedback and Animation Polish"

context:
  description: |
    This task implements a comprehensive visual feedback and animation system that dramatically
    improves user experience and learning effectiveness in the Rust Kanji learning application.
    The system provides immediate, clear visual responses to user actions through animations,
    color-coded feedback, progress indicators, and celebration effects.

    Visual feedback is a critical component of effective learning software. Research shows that
    immediate, clear feedback reinforces correct behavior and helps users quickly identify and
    correct mistakes. This task creates reusable animation components that integrate throughout
    the application:

    - Correct/incorrect/partial answer feedback with color-coded icons
    - Shake effects for errors (oscillating animation with decay)
    - Circular progress indicators for session completion tracking
    - Achievement unlock popups with celebratory slide-in animations
    - Accessibility support for reduced motion preferences

    The architecture emphasizes reusability, performance (targeting 60fps), and accessibility.
    All animations use proper easing curves (cubic for smooth transitions, elastic for playful
    effects), meet WCAG AA contrast requirements, and respect user motion preferences. The
    feedback system integrates with LearningSession, PracticeSession, and Statistics modules
    to provide cohesive visual responses throughout the application.

  key_points:
    - "Feedback animations must be fast (200-500ms) for immediate response; achievement animations can be longer (1-2s) as they're celebratory"
    - "All feedback uses both color AND icon for accessibility (not color alone)"
    - "Shake amplitude must decay smoothly to avoid motion sickness and return to center (0.0) at completion"
    - "Progress indicators update smoothly without jumps, using interpolation"
    - "System must respect prefers-reduced-motion accessibility setting by disabling or reducing animations"
    - "All feedback colors must meet WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1) against white background"
    - "Animations target 60fps performance without frame drops"
    - "Architecture prioritizes reusable components that can be used throughout the application"

formal_verification:
  needed: false
  level: "None"
  explanation: |
    Formal verification is not needed for this task because:
    
    1. **Nature of the System**: Visual feedback animations are inherently subjective
       and aesthetic. They involve timing, easing curves, color transitions, and 
       visual effects that cannot be meaningfully expressed as formal properties.
       The "correctness" of an animation is primarily a UX concern, not a logical one.
    
    2. **No Critical Safety Requirements**: Animation failures do not compromise data
       integrity, user safety, or system security. A failed animation might result in
       visual glitches but won't cause data loss or incorrect learning outcomes.
    
    3. **Simple State Logic**: The animation state machines (Correct/Incorrect/Partial,
       start/running/complete) are straightforward with no complex state transitions
       or race conditions that would benefit from formal verification.
    
    4. **Better Verification Methods**: Animation quality is best verified through:
       - Visual inspection and manual testing
       - Integration testing to ensure animations trigger correctly
       - Performance testing for frame rates
       - Accessibility testing for motion preferences
       - User testing for subjective quality assessment
    
    5. **Low Complexity Risk**: The task is marked as "moderate" complexity with "low"
       complexity and integration risk. The code involves standard animation patterns
       (easing functions, interpolation, timers) that are well-understood.
    
    6. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: The effort required to formalize properties like
       "smooth visual transition" or "pleasing shake effect" would far exceed any
       benefit, as these properties are inherently qualitative and context-dependent.
    
    Integration tests verifying that animations complete within expected timeframes
    and reach their target states are sufficient for this task.

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "mixed (unit + integration)"
    rationale:
      - "Animation timing calculations and state transitions are pure logic suitable for unit tests"
      - "Visual feedback triggering and completion requires integration testing with the iced runtime"
      - "Color contrast calculations can be unit tested for WCAG compliance"
      - "Progress circle rendering logic (angle calculations, arc positioning) benefits from unit tests"
      - "Animation sequencing and message flow requires integration tests to verify proper behavior"
      - "Accessibility features like reduced-motion detection need integration verification"

task:
  id: 13
  name: "UI/UX Polish and Accessibility"

context:
  description: |
    This task implements comprehensive accessibility and UX polish to ensure the application
    meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards and provides a professional, inclusive user experience.
    The task creates a cohesive design system with WCAG-compliant color palettes, consistent
    typography scales, and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
    
    Accessibility is both an ethical imperative and legal requirement in many jurisdictions.
    By implementing proper keyboard navigation, screen reader support, sufficient color contrast,
    and touch-friendly target sizes, we ensure the application is usable by people with
    disabilities including visual impairments, motor disabilities, and those who rely on
    assistive technologies.
    
    Beyond compliance, good UX design reduces cognitive load and makes learning more effective.
    Professional polish builds trust and encourages continued use. Features like keyboard
    shortcuts benefit power users while maintaining mouse/touch accessibility for all users.
    
    The implementation spans all UI components and screens, establishing design tokens (colors,
    typography, spacing) that ensure visual consistency. Responsive layouts ensure the
    application works on devices from mobile phones (320px minimum) to large desktop displays.
    Keyboard shortcuts enable efficient navigation through flashcard reviews, and focus
    indicators provide clear visual feedback for keyboard users.

  key_points:
    - "WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance requires 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text"
    - "Minimum touch target size of 48x48px ensures usability for users with motor impairments"
    - "Keyboard navigation must provide equivalent functionality to mouse/touch interaction"
    - "Focus indicators must be clearly visible with minimum 2px border to aid keyboard users"
    - "Color cannot be the sole indicator of meaning - must include text, icons, or patterns"
    - "Font sizes must not fall below 12px minimum, with 14-16px recommended for body text"
    - "8px base unit spacing creates consistent visual rhythm throughout the application"
    - "Responsive breakpoints at 320px (mobile), 640px (tablet), 1024px (desktop) ensure adaptability"
    - "Screen reader support requires descriptive labels and logical focus order"
    - "Keyboard shortcuts (1-5 for quality ratings, Space for next, Escape for cancel) improve efficiency"

formal_verification:
  needed: false
  level: "None"
  explanation: |
    Formal verification is not needed for UI/UX polish and accessibility improvements.
    This task primarily involves:
    
    1. Visual design constants (color palettes, typography scales, spacing values)
    2. Layout adjustments and responsive behavior
    3. UI event handlers for keyboard navigation
    4. WCAG compliance metrics (contrast ratios, target sizes)
    
    These are subjective user experience concerns and compliance requirements rather
    than algorithmic correctness problems. The "correctness" criteria are defined by
    external standards (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) and user testing, not mathematical properties.
    
    While certain aspects could theoretically be verified (e.g., "all contrast ratios
    >= 4.5:1"), these are better validated through:
    - Automated accessibility testing tools (axe-core, WAVE)
    - Manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation
    - Integration tests verifying keyboard event handlers fire correctly
    - User acceptance testing with accessibility consultants
    
    The risk profile is low for correctness bugs that would benefit from formal methods.
    Bugs in this domain manifest as poor UX or accessibility violations, which are
    caught through manual testing and automated linting, not formal proofs. The
    complexity risk is low, and there are no concurrent operations, state machines,
    or complex algorithms that would benefit from verification.

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "integration tests with manual verification guidance"
    rationale:
      - "Accessibility and UX polish are primarily manual testing concerns that require human judgment and assistive technology"
      - "Automated tests verify measurable properties: contrast ratios, minimum dimensions, keyboard handler presence"
      - "Integration tests ensure accessibility features work across the actual UI components"
      - "Manual test procedures documented as structured test cases to ensure consistent verification"
      - "Focus on testable invariants: color values, size constraints, focus order logic"
      - "Cannot fully automate screen reader testing but can verify ARIA-like attributes if present"

task:
  id: 14
  name: "Testing, Documentation, and Release Preparation"

context:
  description: |
    This task transforms the working Hanzi learning application prototype into a production-ready,
    shippable product through comprehensive quality assurance, user-facing documentation, and
    professional distribution packaging. It implements thorough test coverage exceeding 80% across
    unit, integration, property-based, and performance benchmarks to ensure correctness and prevent
    regressions. User manual documentation enables users to maximize application value and reduces
    support burden. Platform-specific release builds and distribution packages (AppImage/deb for
    Linux, app bundle for macOS, MSI installer for Windows) ensure smooth installation and
    professional first impressions. Automated CI/CD pipeline enables continuous testing and
    streamlined release process.

    This is the final task in the development roadmap, validating that all previous tasks (1-13)
    integrate correctly and meet quality standards. The testing infrastructure includes integration
    tests exercising complete learning session workflows, property-based tests verifying mathematical
    correctness of the SM-2 algorithm, and performance benchmarks establishing baseline metrics for
    critical paths like animation rendering (60fps target) and database operations (<100ms batch saves).

    The documentation provides user-focused guides covering Getting Started, Features, and
    Troubleshooting sections, enabling new users to complete their first learning session within
    10 minutes. Release configurations optimize binary size and performance through LTO, aggressive
    optimization levels, and symbol stripping. Distribution packages include all necessary dependencies
    and follow platform conventions for professional installation experiences.

  key_points:
    - "Test coverage exceeds 80% through mixed strategy: unit tests for components, integration tests for workflows, property-based tests for algorithms, benchmarks for performance"
    - "Property-based testing verifies SM-2 algorithm mathematical properties: interval monotonicity, ease factor bounds [1.3, 2.5], and quality score handling"
    - "Performance benchmarks establish and enforce critical path targets: 60fps animation, <100ms database batch saves, <200ms recognition latency"
    - "User manual built with mdBook provides searchable, professional documentation with Getting Started, Features, and Troubleshooting sections"
    - "Release profile optimization: opt-level=3, lto=true, strip=true, codegen-units=1 for minimal binary size and maximum performance"
    - "Platform-specific packaging: AppImage/deb for Linux, signed app bundle for macOS, MSI installer for Windows with appropriate code signing"
    - "CI/CD pipeline automates testing on all platforms and builds distribution packages on tagged releases"
    - "Integration tests use temporary databases to avoid polluting production data and enable parallel test execution"
    - "Concurrent database access tests verify thread safety and absence of race conditions or deadlocks"
    - "Regression tests ensure compatibility with previous database schemas and configuration files"
    - "Manual testing on clean VMs catches dependency issues and validates installation experience"

formal_verification:
  needed: false
  level: "None"
  explanation: |
    Formal verification is not needed for this task because:
    
    1. This is primarily a meta-task focused on quality assurance, documentation,
       and packaging rather than implementing critical algorithmic logic. The core
       algorithms (SM-2, recognition, etc.) were implemented in previous tasks.
    
    2. Testing infrastructure itself does not require formal verification - tests
       are validated by their ability to catch bugs and their coverage metrics.
       Property-based tests will be written to verify algorithm properties, but
       the test harness itself is standard tooling.
    
    3. Documentation and build configuration are declarative artifacts that are
       validated through human review and successful compilation/packaging rather
       than formal proofs.
    
    4. The components that do have critical properties (SM-2 algorithm, statistics
       calculations) will be verified through property-based testing (using proptest),
       which provides probabilistic verification that is sufficient for this domain.
       These properties were already specified in previous tasks (Tasks 5, 8, etc.).
    
    5. Platform-specific packaging and build configurations are validated through
       integration testing on actual target platforms and manual verification that
       installers work correctly - formal verification is not applicable to this
       type of system integration work.
    
    6. Performance benchmarks establish empirical baselines rather than proving
       theoretical bounds, making formal verification inappropriate.
    
    The property-based tests mentioned in the task (for SM-2 and statistics) will
    verify the mathematical properties defined in their respective implementation
    tasks, but this verification task itself does not introduce new properties
    requiring formal proof.

tests:
  strategy:
    approach: "mixed"
    rationale:
      - "Integration tests verify complete workflows (learning sessions, practice modes) end-to-end"
      - "Property-based tests ensure SM-2 algorithm correctness across all input ranges"
      - "Unit tests validate individual components (statistics, database operations, animations)"
      - "Performance benchmarks establish baseline metrics for critical paths"
      - "Manual testing on target platforms validates distribution packages"
      - "Mixed approach provides >80% coverage while catching edge cases and regressions"
