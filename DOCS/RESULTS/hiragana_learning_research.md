I'll synthesize the research findings into a comprehensive documentation file.
Created comprehensive implementation guide at `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (29KB). The document synthesizes all research findings into:

**11 Major Sections:**
1. Architecture overview with component diagram and tech stack
2. Character data management (JSON structures, lookups, 208-character coverage)
3. Stroke animation with femtovg/wgpu + code examples
4. Visual recognition using ort + DPW/HOG algorithms
5. Progress tracking with SQLite + SM-2/FSRS spaced repetition
6. Interactive UI/UX patterns for iced framework
7. Testing strategies (unit, integration, validation)
8. 6-phase implementation checklist (12 weeks)
9. Performance targets (95%+ recognition, 60 FPS)
10. Key resources (datasets, libraries, algorithms)
11. Next steps for prototyping

Includes **15+ code examples** in Rust, database schemas, algorithm implementations, and architectural patterns ready for development.
